# Research Question 3: Depth Imbalance

## Visualized Data

## Results

I only focus on Nikkei 225, Nikkei 225 Mini, TOPIX, TOPIX Mini and JGBL, just like in research question 2.

- TOPIX and Nikkei 225
  - Market is more likely to move 
  - 

- Higher chance of larger market move when it's less liquid.
