# Prediction Overview

I will first generate data based on my simulation, then feed that data to machine learning models.

Final result will report the accuracy and feature importance per model.
List of models are presented on the final result page.

I will not introduce my own ML models. My knowledge/experience on building ML models are severely limited. Although I tried, I decided that it is better to work with other people model, and focus on things like data generation and feature engineering.
