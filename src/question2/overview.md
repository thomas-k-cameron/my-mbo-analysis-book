# Research Question 2: Prediction Machine
## Overview
I initially tried to use first 12 days of data as a training set, and rest the of data as a validation set.

The goal of this research was to    
- bulid a model that is capable of predicting the market move, and
- if the order's speed can improve the model


It didn't work, mostly for technical issues.  
I describe the reason on `What went wrong` section.
